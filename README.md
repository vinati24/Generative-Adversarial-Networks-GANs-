# GAN Implementation Using PyTorch

This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator.
